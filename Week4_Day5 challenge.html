//Create a function that takes in two strings as two parameters and returns a boolean that indicates 
//whether or not the first string is an anagram of the second string.
//Help: An anagram is another word or phrase formed by rearranging letters of the first word
//Trim whitespace prior to comparison.
//PLAN of SOLUTION:
//* declare string1, string2 and give them values;
    //transform each string to array from separate characters by split("") METHOD;
//* trim whitespaces from each array;
//* meassure such property of string as length;
//* sort characters of string by alphabet;
//* create a function that returns boolean result of comparison two arrays from strings along following algorithm:
//    ** if length of arrays aren't the same => result = false (it is not anagram),
//    ** if length of arrays are the same => compare X-Y, where X,Y = 2a4c7m10s (characters by alphabet and their amonts - example),
//    ** if X-Y = 0 => result = true (it is anagram),
//    ** if X-Y = 0 => result = false (it is not anagram).
